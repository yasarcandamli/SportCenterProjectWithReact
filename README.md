# Web Interactive Features Project

## Description

This project includes various interactive features for a web application, implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Key functionalities include a responsive navigation bar with scroll effects, a hamburger menu for mobile navigation, section switching based on button clicks, and a Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator.

## Interactive Features

### 1. Navbar Scroll Effect

- The navbar changes its style based on the scroll position. When the user scrolls beyond the height of the navbar, it applies a `nav-scroll` class to change its appearance.

### 2. Hamburger Menu

- A hamburger menu is available for mobile devices, allowing users to toggle navigation visibility. The menu expands and collapses based on user interaction.

### 3. Section Switching

- Users can click on buttons to display different sections of content dynamically. This is achieved by hiding all sections and showing only the targeted section.

### 4. BMI Calculator

- The BMI calculator allows users to input their height and weight, calculates the BMI, and displays the result along with a pointer indicating their BMI category on a scale.
